# Beginner
This is my first Git Repository. I am learning how to use Github and Git.

        GIT
--------------------
It is a Version Control System. <br>
It is a Open Source Software. <br>
It is Popular and Fast. <br>
It allows users to Track Changes in Code. <br>
It provides CheckPoints to the users by which they can revert to the previous code. <br>


      GITHUB
----------------------
It is a Cloud-based Platform (Website). <br>
It is built over the functionality of Git. <br>
Here, Developers Upload their Codes on the Platform. <br>
And Fellow Developers Pull Requests for the Changes in the Code. <br>
It is a Code Collaborator Platform which allows Developers to Share, Collaborate and make Changes in the Code. <br>
